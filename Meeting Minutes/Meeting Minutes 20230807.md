Group: 9785-23-7
Date & Time: Monday 7/8/23, 2:30pm - 3:20pm
Present: Curtis, Ellie, Yibe
Apologies: Daniel
Method: Physical; UC 6B42 (Cybersecurity Collaboration Space; Internal to Computer Science Lab)
Next Meeting: Saturday 12/8/23, afternoon

## Agenda
* Discuss method for interacting with simulation environment
* Remind Yibe to send through username for GitHub for addition to Project management overview/pages
* Discuss project administration from faculty perspective

## Discussion
* Due to concerns of driver incompatibilities within the kernel, the decision was taken to _**not**_ capture an image from the current hardware for import to Azure
	* Instead, the packages installed for interaction with the NS3 software was recorded, and will be manually installed for the base OS of the VM
* Yibe said he would send through the username for Git and provide access to the Azure VM, today
	* Yibe stated we should contact him if it doesn't happen today (7/8/2023)
* Our project has been officially sponsored by Yibe, and recognised by UC SciTech Faculty
	* Our allocated mentor for the project is **Maryam Sousani**
	* It would be good to add Maryam's GitHub user to the project page, so she has visibility of the project she's mentoring
	* No individual volunteered to get in touch with Maryam regarding meeting, so any member should send an introductory email to Maryam and carbon copy the other members

## Action Items
* Yibe to send GitHub username to Curtis/all members
	* Once username sent through, members (first able) to add accesses to his user to view/interact (where necessary) with project management pages/functions
* Yibe to create an Ubuntu-based (likely to be Xubuntu) Azure VM for group to have single highly available simulation instance
	* Yibe to provide access (possibly some additional, though limited, management actions) to that VM - access will be provided at the very least to Curtis, initially, though may be provided to all members simultaneously
* Curtis and Ellie to brush up on / familiarise themselves with their Git interaction skillset
* All members to add task items to GitHub Kanban board when they think of anything that could be described as a task (related to the project)
* Any member to email Maryam with introduction, and cc the other members
