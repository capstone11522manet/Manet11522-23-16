## Agenda
* Discuss plan to get Azure VM image running
* Get GitHub repository ready for git commits _et al_
* 

## Discussion
* Ellie reminders:
	* AIM due by 1/9/23 - best to complete and submit today/soon
	* Reflection eJournal piece due every Sunday - best to complete and submit today/by end of tomorrow
* Collaborator access to repository still required
	* Curtis added "collaborator" access to Daniel and Ellie (previously, just provided viewing access to project)

## Action Items
* Daniel will put together a SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) for connecting to, and updating the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/edcricho/Manet9785-23-7) 
* All members to complete the eJournal piece and submit by due date
* Curtis to select a P2V (Physical-To-Virtual) methodology, to get OS image from notebooks, to Azure cloud (under UC ownership) for remote access by group members

## Other Business
* This was a heavily action-oriented meeting; members used the time to fill out Kanban board and Gantt chart (both hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/users/edcricho/projects/1/views/1)) for initial project items, while discussing high-level goals for the project
* Fun note: GitHub has an interesting function when a user is logged in, and on a repository page - typing "." on your keyboard on the page, opens the web version of Visual Studio Code, with the repository open inside this instance
